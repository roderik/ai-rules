## Execution Rules (Check FIRST)

### Critical Output Format

**Frontmatter (mandatory):**
- `title`: 2-3 words for sidebar
- `pageTitle`: Full descriptive title for header/browser
- `description`: 2-3 sentence intro (rendered separately - NEVER repeat as first body paragraph)
- `tags`: 3-6 lowercase keywords

**Mermaid diagrams:**
- ✅ `<Mermaid chart={\`flowchart TB\n A --> B\`} />` (self-closing JSX)
- ❌ ` ```mermaid\nflowchart TB\n A --> B\n``` ` (markdown blocks fail)
- Node shape: `NodeID(Label)` rounded rectangles, not `NodeID[Label]` squares
- Node IDs: start with letter/$/_, never number (use `Step1` not `1`)
- Layout: vertical `TB` not horizontal `LR`
- Colors: Primary `fill:#5fc9bf,stroke:#3a9d96,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff`, Secondary `fill:#6ba4d4,stroke:#4a7ba8,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff`, Tertiary `fill:#8571d9,stroke:#654bad,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff`, Quaternary `fill:#b661d9,stroke:#8a3fb3,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff`

**Character encoding (MDX requirement):**
- Use `&lt;` not `<` (less than)
- Use `&gt;` not `>` (greater than)
- Use `&amp;` not `&` (ampersand)
- Applies to ALL content (MDX parses `<` as JSX tag opening)
- Example: `Target: &lt;2s` not `Target: <2s`

**Tables:**
- Blank line before table header
- Separator: `|------|------| not |--|--|`
- Each row on own line

**Version numbers:**
- ✅ `(version 1.133)`
- ❌ `(v1.133)` - MDX parsing issues

### Content Requirements

**Factual grounding:**
- Reference source code, docs, architecture diagrams
- Link functions/classes to GitHub: `[functionName](https://github.com/.../file.sol#L123)`
- Use permalinks (commit SHA) or `main` branch
- Line ranges: `#L10-L25`
- No placeholder content, lorem ipsum, or unverified claims

**Banned phrases:**
unlock, game-changing, end-to-end, dive into, revolutionary, leverage, synergy, paradigm shift, ecosystem, seamless, robust, cutting-edge

**Quality gates:**
- Sentence case headings (not Title Case) - `"Frontend layer: Web application"` not `"Frontend Layer: Web Application"`
- Paragraphs: 2-4 sentences max
- Active voice: `"platform tokenizes assets"` not `"tokenization is achieved by platform"`
- Define acronyms on first use
- Bold key terms on first mention

## Tone Matrix by Section

| Section | Tone | Voice | Jargon Level | Example |
|---------|------|-------|--------------|---------|
| Executive | Conversational-professional | we/you | Low - explain all terms | "Settlement takes days. That's friction you feel every quarter-end." |
| Architecture | Formal-precise | neutral | High - use correct terms | "ERC-3643 implements transfer restrictions via on-chain eligibility verification" |
| User Guides | Instructional-reassuring | you (imperative) | Medium - define as needed | "Click 'Deploy'. You'll see a confirmation within 30 seconds." |
| Developer | Technical-concise | imperative | High - assume familiarity | "Run `forge test`. Verify all assertions pass." |

## Style Guidelines

**Clarity:**
- Direct sentences, active voice
- Vary sentence length (avoid monotony)
- Simple grammar for non-native readers
- One idea per paragraph

**Consistency:**
- Maintain terminology within context (don't alternate "investor"/"user" randomly)
- Proper noun capitalization (SMART Protocol, OnchainID, PostgreSQL)
- Contractions: match section style (narrative = natural, technical = formal)

**Engagement (Executive sections only):**
- Rhetorical questions: "Why hasn't this been solved?"
- Emotional language: friction, pain points, confidence, peace of mind
- Use sparingly in technical sections
- Never sacrifice credibility for excitement

**Accessibility:**
- Define acronyms on first use: "multi-signature (multisig) wallets"
- Explain diagrams in adjacent text
- Gender-neutral language ("the user" / "you" / "they")
- Avoid untranslatable idioms

## Structural Components

**Use when they improve comprehension, not for visual flair:**
- **Tabs** - Content variants (code samples per framework, multi-env configs)
- **Accordion** - Collapsible optional content (FAQs, troubleshooting)
- **Banner** - Notices, warnings, tips
- **CodeBlock** - Syntax highlighting for code snippets
- **Files** - Directory trees and file structures
- **Steps** - Sequential tutorials and setup procedures
- **Cards** - Feature overviews, option comparisons, navigation grids

Default to markdown. Use components when structure naturally demands them.
**Headings:**
- Clear hierarchy: H1 (from frontmatter) → H2 (major) → H3 (sub)
- Descriptive, not generic: "Compliance by design in SMART contracts" not "Compliance"
- Sentence case only (capitalize first word + proper nouns)

**Paragraphs:**
- 2-4 sentences max
- One idea per paragraph
- Single-sentence paragraphs OK for emphasis

**Lists:**
- Numbered for procedures (sequential steps)
- Bullets for features/collections
- Parallel structure (all items start with verb if procedural)

**Tables:**
- Use for comparisons (feature matrices, data field references)
- Already covered in Execution Rules above

**Emphasis:**
- **Bold** key terms on first mention
- _Italic_ sparingly (scenario framing)
- No ALL-CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!
**Mermaid usage:**
- Use frequently: architectures, workflows, processes
- Introduce with explanatory text
- Aim for one diagram per major page
- Base on source docs (don't invent flows)
- Flowcharts for processes, sequence diagrams for interactions
- (Detailed syntax rules already in Execution Rules above)

**Images/screenshots:**
- Include with figure captions
- Mandatory alt text describing image content
- Placeholder text OK: "Screenshot: Asset creation form"

**Code blocks:**
- Markdown fencing with language labels: ` ```solidity `, ` ```bash `, ` ```json `
- Keep focused (relevant function, not whole contract)
- Explain in preceding text or inline comments
- Truncate irrelevant output

**Cross-references:**
- Link between pages liberally
- Descriptive link text: "Smart Contract Reference" not "click here"
- First mention of key concept → link to dedicated page

**SEO optimization:**
- Keywords in headings and body (natural usage)
- Answer common questions directly in prose
- Example: "ATK ensures regulatory compliance by embedding KYC/AML rules into smart contracts (via ERC-3643 standard) so any token transfer is automatically checked against eligibility criteria."

## Document Templates by Type

**Concept pages (architecture, features):**
- Intro paragraph explaining concept
- Avoid how-to instructions (save for guides)
- Focus on understanding "what" and "why"

**How-to pages (procedures):**
- Goal statement
- Prerequisites (if any)
- Numbered steps with expected results
- Conclusion / next steps

**Tutorial pages (end-to-end workflows):**
- Scenario intro
- Sequential steps
- Wrap-up: "Now you have X working"
- Prerequisites section

**Reference pages (API, data models):**
- Systematic presentation (tables, definition lists)
- Brief, factual explanations
- No narrative fluff

## Pre-Generation Checklist

Before writing any page:
- [ ] Source material gathered (code, existing docs, architecture diagrams)
- [ ] Contradictions in sources resolved
- [ ] Target audience identified (executive/architect/user/developer)
- [ ] Document type determined (concept/how-to/tutorial/reference)
- [ ] Required diagrams/tables mapped to content structure
- [ ] Cross-reference targets identified (what pages link here?)

## Post-Generation Validation

After writing, verify:
- [ ] Description field ≠ first body paragraph (avoids duplication)
- [ ] All code refs link to GitHub with `#L` line numbers
- [ ] Mermaid uses rounded nodes `()` not square `[]`
- [ ] Special chars encoded: `&lt;` `&gt;` `&amp;` where needed
- [ ] No banned phrases (unlock, game-changing, end-to-end, etc.)
- [ ] Headings are sentence case
- [ ] Acronyms defined on first use
- [ ] Cross-references added where appropriate
