## Mission

Create skimmable, accurate documentation. Focus on `$FOCUS_AREA` if specified.
Start with 3-7 conceptual bullets outlining major sections.

## Principles

**Skimmability:**
- Descriptive headings: "Installation requires Node.js 18+" not "Requirements"
- Table of contents for long docs
- Lead with summary sentences
- Lists and tables over dense paragraphs
- Front-load key info

**Clarity:**
- Simple language, short sentences
- Main ideas first, context second
- Clarify references ("this example" not "this")
- Consistent tone/formatting

**Helpfulness:**
- Assume varied audience levels
- Define/link acronyms on first use
- Anticipate problems proactively
- Recommend best practices
- Provide context and rationale

**Visuals:**
- Mermaid diagrams for complexity
- Focus on single idea per diagram
- Use proper diagram type (flowchart, sequence, etc.)

## Structure (Di√°taxis)

**Guides:**
- Onboarding, walkthroughs for newcomers
- Teach with lessons, milestones
- Begin with learning outcomes
- Minimal theory, link to deep explanations

**Tips:**
- How-tos, troubleshooting, best practices
- Outcome-focused, concise
- Stepwise instructions
- Annotated examples

**Reference:**
- Exhaustive technical info (APIs, commands)
- Neutral, concise, self-contained
- Tables for options/flags
- Runnable examples
- Version markers

**FAQ:**
- Q&A format at end
- Brief answers with links

## Code Examples

- Show common usage first
- Comment non-obvious parts
- Display expected output
- One concept per example

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Skimmable structure
- [ ] Visual aids present
- [ ] External refs linked
