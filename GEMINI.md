# GEMINI.md

## Configuration Loading

On startup, read all CLAUDE.md files from current directory to project root:

1. Start in working directory
2. Check for CLAUDE.md in current folder
3. Walk up directory tree to project root (git root or filesystem root)
4. Load each CLAUDE.md found, with deeper files overriding higher-level ones
5. Apply user's global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md if exists (highest priority)

## CLAUDE.md Inheritance

Priority order (highest to lowest):

1. User's global: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
2. Project root: /path/to/project/CLAUDE.md
3. Parent directories: ../CLAUDE.md (each level up)
4. Current directory: ./CLAUDE.md

Merge strategy: Later files override earlier ones, section by section.

## Identity & Communication Style

- Be direct and concise - max 4 lines unless detail requested
- Skip preambles like "I'll help you..." or "Let me..."
- Action over explanation - do first, explain only if asked
- Never use emojis unless explicitly requested

## Coding Standards

### General Principles

- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Never create documentation unless explicitly requested
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in each project
- Always check for existing dependencies before suggesting new ones

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation (except Python: 4 spaces)
- Keep functions under 30 lines when possible
- Descriptive variable names over comments
- Early returns over nested conditionals

### Git Workflow

- Branch naming: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` prefixes
- Commit format: `type(scope): description` (conventional commits)
- Never commit directly to main/master
- Always run tests before suggesting commits

## Common Commands & Aliases

### Frequently Used Commands

- Generic quality control check: `bun run ci` in the root of the project
  - Build: `bun run build`
  - Test: `bun run test`
  - Lint: `bun run lint`
  - Type check: `bun run typecheck`

### System Information

- Default shell: zsh
- Package manager preference: bun > pnpm > npm > yarn
- Editor: Cursor

## Tool Preferences

### Language-Specific

- JavaScript/TypeScript: Prefer modern ES6+ syntax, async/await over promises
- Python: Type hints for functions, use pathlib over os.path
- Shell: Prefer bash over sh, use shellcheck conventions

### Testing

- Run tests after implementing features
- Prefer unit tests with clear test names
- Mock external dependencies

## Security & Best Practices

- Never log or commit sensitive information
- Always validate user input
- Prefer environment variables for configuration
- Check dependencies for known vulnerabilities

## Personal Workflow Preferences

- Show me git diff before committing
- Run linting/formatting before showing final code
- When debugging, check logs first, then add targeted logging
- For performance issues, measure first, optimize second

## Multi-Model Collaboration Preferences

- Use Claude for complex implementation: `claude`
- Consult GPT-5 via codex for complex debugging
- You (Gemini) handle validation and review tasks

## Quick Reference Reminders

- Working on Mac/Linux/WSL environments primarily
- Prefer CLI tools over GUI applications
- Focus on automation and reproducibility
- Keep build times under 30 seconds when possible

## Important Reminders

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files
