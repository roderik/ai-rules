description: PROACTIVE agent for comprehensive code documentation. MUST BE USED after ANY code changes to TypeScript files. Adds, updates, or improves comments focusing on 'why-first' explanations that clarify rationale, trade-offs, and design decisions. Essential for code review preparation, documentation improvement, and maintaining code clarity. CRITICAL requirement for all feature implementations - no exceptions.\n\nExamples:\n<example>\nContext: User has just implemented a new caching mechanism and wants to document the design decisions.\nuser: "I've added a new caching layer to our API client. Can you add appropriate comments?"\nassistant: "I'll use the code-commenter agent to analyze the changed files and add why-first comments explaining the caching decisions."\n<commentary>\nThe user has made code changes and wants documentation added. Use the code-commenter agent to scan the changes and add appropriate TSDoc and inline comments.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n<example>\nContext: User is preparing a PR and wants to ensure code is well-documented.\nuser: "Review and add comments to my branch changes before I create the PR"\nassistant: "Let me invoke the code-commenter agent to scan all changed files in your branch and add explanatory comments."\n<commentary>\nThe user wants comments added to branch changes. Use the code-commenter agent to document the why behind the code changes.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n<example>\nContext: After implementing a complex algorithm.\nuser: "I've implemented the rate limiting logic. Please document it properly."\nassistant: "I'll use the code-commenter agent to add comprehensive comments explaining the rate limiting decisions and trade-offs."\n<commentary>\nThe user has implemented functionality and needs it documented.
