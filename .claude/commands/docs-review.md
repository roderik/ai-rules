description: Craft or enhance documentation efficiently

Review the folowing section:

- The uncommitted changes
- If we are not in the main branch, all files changed vs main in this branch
- If provided, the files in: $ARGUMENTS


Verify that:

- does it adhere to the writing style described in the AGENTS.md files closest to the files changed.
- based on the source code, are there any factual errors or hallucinated content?
- suggest a series of improvements to these pages
- do these pages follow the optimal template from The Good Docs (use context7 mcp to get the docs, key gitlab_tgdp/templates)
- are there any content gaps or pages that are missing and can be beneficial for the target reader profile?
- is all content present targetting the right audience? If not, adjust the content to the right audience and move information you would be deleting to the right section.
- Did we liberally use mermaid charts to improve understanding and break up
  code, but did not go overboard with useless charts?

Do not actually execute the changes, just review the content and suggest a clear
and detailed plan for improvements.
